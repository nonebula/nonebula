# nonebula

## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Joe/nonebula, a passionate Frontend Developer based in London, UK. With a background in Teaching and a lifelong interest in computer science, I thrive on turning ideas into reality through code. My journey through EdX's Frontend Web Development Bootcamp has equipped me with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.

Currently, I'm focused on freelance work and finding a role at an organization where I can hone my skills and progress in my career. When I'm not coding, you can find me running, climbing, cooking, or buried in TV shows and films.

## Interests and Hobbies:

- **Interests:** I'm passionate about TV & Film, learning and literature. I love to learn, whether it's exploring new technologies, diving into the latest scientific discoveries, or delving into the world of literature, I'm always eager to learn and expand my horizons.
  
- **Hobbies:** When I'm not coding, you can often find me climbing, running or riding along a canal in the City, or trying out a new restaurant. I love to keep active, but I'm not averse to the odd lazy movie marathon Sunday!

- **Personal Projects:** In my free time, I love working on personal projects that allow me to continue learning and growing on this journey. Throughout my profile, you can find a variety of projects, but my biggest passion is undoubtedly GuardianStreetMapper, which I'd love to develop fully for public use in the future.

- **Fun Fact:** One fun fact about me is that I'm a pub quiz and karaoke maniac. Find me a pub quiz or a karaoke mic and you won't soon forget it!
