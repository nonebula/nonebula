# nonebula

## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Joe/nonebula, a passionate Frontend Developer based in London, UK. With a background in Teaching and a lifelong interest in computer science, I thrive on turning ideas into reality through code. My journey through EdX's Frontend Web Development Bootcamp has equipped me with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.

Currently, I'm focused on freelance work and finding a role at an organization where I can hone my skills and progress in my career. When I'm not coding, you can find me running, climbing, cooking, or buried in TV shows and films.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! Feel free to reach out via higgs92@icloud.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.

Looking forward to creating something awesome together! ðŸš€
